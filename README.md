## 👋 About Me

I'm a full-stack engineer specializing in end-to-end product development. I combine backend architecture, frontend precision, and infrastructure expertise to deliver production-ready software that handles real transactions and scales with user demand.

My focus is on **practical solutions** — not architectural theory projects. Every system I build is designed for production from day one: performant, maintainable, and reliable.

**Background:** Over the years, I've worked across diverse domains including ERP systems, e-commerce platforms, SaaS applications, and consumer mobile apps. Whether it's customizing Odoo workflows, integrating payment processors, or launching apps to the App Store, I prioritize shipping quality software quickly.
